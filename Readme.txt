Independent Study:
-Data generated from random normal function (rnorm) in R and it was trained using SVM by varying the form of data and kernel.
eg: In SVM normal file (data generated using Rnorm and SVMLinear, SVMPolynomial, SVMRadial, SVMSigmoid methods are used for simulation).
Similarly, in SVM uniform file data was generated from Runif function.
-Obtained results are then compared with standard regression models.
-All the methods are then applied on house pricing data and compared with the results of ordinary linear regression.
-Similar type of simulation for regression is then performed using Ensemble techniques.
